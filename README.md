# **Near Bankruptcy**

**Brackeys Game Jam 2025.2 Submission**

**Theme:** Risk It for the Biscuit

### **About the Game**

*Near Bankruptcy* is a high-stakes, risk-reward-based game where every decision could be your last. Navigate through 10 challenging levels, each more difficult than the last, and make calculated risks to maximize your profit. The more risks you take, the bigger your reward—but also the greater the chance of losing it all.

### **Gameplay Mechanics**

* **High-Stakes Levels:** Each of the 10 levels presents a unique challenge.  
* **Risk-Reward System:** Every action has a cost. The faster you complete a level and the fewer items you use, the larger your money multiplier will be at the end.  
* **Item Management:** You have a limited number of item slots. Choose wisely, as using items makes your final payout smaller.  
* **Death & Consequences:** Dying in a level doesn't end the game, but it does mean you lose all the money you've earned on that level and you loose money to be revived. Money acts as your overall healthbar for the game. Will you play it safe, or risk it all for a bigger payout?  
* **The Shop:** Between each level, you can spend your hard-earned cash on new items and upgrades to help you on the next stage.
